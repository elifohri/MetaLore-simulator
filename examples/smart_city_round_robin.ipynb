    "* **Flexibility and Customizability**:\n",
    "   - `mobile-env:smart-city` is written entirely in Python, making it easy to modify and extend.\n",
    "   - The environment allows the simulation of a smart city scenario with mobile users (UEs), stationary sensors and a single base station (BS).\n",
    "   - The number of UEs, sensors, their movement patterns, communication properties and the structure of the network can all be customized to suit a variety of experimental needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Compatibility with Gymnasium**:\n",
    "   - `mobile-env:smart-city` adheres to the [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) (formerly [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/)) interface. This ensures compatibility with most reinforcement learning libraries and frameworks, allowing users to experiment with different RL algorithms with minimal integration effort.\n",
    "   - Using the Gymnasium interface allows easy integration with popular RL libraries such as Stable-Baselines3, RLlib, or custom-built agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Not Limited to RL**:\n",
    "   - While the environment is designed with RL in mind, `mobile-env:smart-city` is not restricted to RL algorithms. It can also be used to implement and test conventional control policies or simple rule-based benchmark algorithms. This flexibility enables users to benchmark RL algorithms against traditional approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Realistic Network Simulation**:\n",
    "   - The environment includes realistic simulations of mobile user equipment (UEs), cellular network base stations (BS) and sensors. \n",
    "   - UEs move dynamically and their communication quality (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio) changes based on their position relative to the base station. \n",
    "   - The scenarios are focused on exploring dynamic resource allocation in cellular networks for smart city applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Extensibility**:\n",
    "   - Developers can easily extend the functionality of `mobile-env:smart-city` by modifying or adding custom observation spaces, action spaces or reward functions.\n",
    "   - It allows simulation of dynamic scenarios, for example, by implementing custom movement patterns for UEs, different scheduling policies for base stations or adding new types of observations and rewards based on the needs of the experiment."
