    "`mobile-env` is a simple and open environment for training, testing, and evaluating a decentralized metaverse environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `mobile-env:smart-city` is written in pure Python\n",
    "* It allows simulating various scenarios with moving users in a cellular network with a single base station and multiple stationary sensors\n",
    "* `mobile-env:smart-city` implements the standard [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) (previously [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/)) interface such that it can be used with all common frameworks for reinforcement learning\n",
    "* `mobile-env:smart-city` is not restricted to reinforcement learning approaches but can also be used with conventional control approaches or dummy benchmark algorithms\n",
    "* It can be configured easily (e.g., adjusting number and movement of users, properties of cells, etc.)\n",
    "* It is also easy to extend `mobile-env:smart-city`, e.g., implementing different observations, actions, or reward\n",
